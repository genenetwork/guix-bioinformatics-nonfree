    (description
     "FastQC aims to provide a QC report which can spot problems which originate
either in the sequencer or in the starting library material.  It can either run
as a stand alone interactive application for the immediate analysis of small
numbers of FastQ files, or it can be run in a non-interactive mode where it
would be suitable for integrating into a larger analysis pipeline for the
systematic processing of large numbers of files.")
    ;; FastQC is licensed GPLv3+, but one of its dependencies (JHDF5) is
    ;; licensed ASL2.0.
